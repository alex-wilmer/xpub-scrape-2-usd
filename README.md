## Scrape Blockchain xpub Wallet balance

I couldn't find an API for this and I haven't scraped anything in a while.

    git clone https://github.com/alex-wilmer/xpub-scrape-2-usd.git
    cd xpub-scrape-2-usd
    npm install
    node dest/app

Navigate to `localhost:8081/getPrice`

Be sure to run `gulp` from the root directory
if you'd like to make changes to `src/app.js`

Have fun!
